# Markdown Previewer Project
This is the markdown previewer project for [Free Code Camp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org)

It was created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
for more info see [REACT-README.md](REACT-README.md)

## Here are the user requirements for the project
1. I can see a textarea element with a corresponding `id="editor"`.
2. I can see an element with a corresponding `id="preview"`.
3. When I enter text into the `#editor` element, the `#preview` element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.
4. When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the `#editor` element, the text is rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: [https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked)).
5. When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the `#editor` field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
6. When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the `#editor` field should be rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element.

**Optional Bonus:** When I click a link rendered by my markdown previewer, the link is opened up in a new tab (HINT: read the Marked.js docs for this one!).

**Optional Bonus:** My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.
